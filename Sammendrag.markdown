The Long Tail
-------------

The phrase the Long Tail describes the niche strategy of businesses that sell a large number of unique items, each in relatively small quantities. The distribution and inventory costs of these businesses allow them to realize significant profit out of selling small volumes of hard-to-find items to many customers, instead of only selling large volumes of a reduced number of popular items. The group that purchases a large number of "non-hit" items is the demographic called the Long Tail.

Given a large enough availability of choice, a large population of customers, and negligible stocking and distribution costs, the selection and buying pattern of the population results in a power law distribution curve, or Pareto distribution.

It is a common term in online business and the mass media, but also of importance in micro-finance (Grameen Bank, for example), user-driven innovation (Eric von Hippel), social network mechanisms (e.g., crowdsourcing, crowdcasting, Peer-to-peer), economic models, and marketing (viral marketing).

In "long-tailed" distributions a high-frequency or high-amplitude population is followed by a low-frequency or low-amplitude population which gradually "tails off" asymptotically. The events at the far end of the tail have a very low probability of occurrence.

Anderson argued that products that are in low demand or have low sales volume can collectively make up a market share that rivals or exceeds the relatively few current bestsellers and blockbusters, if the store or distribution channel is large enough.

By greatly lowering search costs, information technology in general and Internet markets in particular could substantially increase the collective share of hard-to-find products, thereby creating a longer tail in the distribution of sales.

The key supply-side factor that determines whether a sales distribution has a Long Tail is the cost of inventory storage and distribution. Where inventory storage and distribution costs are insignificant, it becomes economically viable to sell relatively unpopular products. On the supply side expanded, centralized warehousing allows for more offerings, thus making it possible for them to cater to more varied tastes. On the demand side, tools such as search engines, recommendation software, and sampling tools are allowing customers to find products outside their geographic area.

The Long Tail may threaten established businesses. Before a Long Tail works, only the most popular products are generally offered. When the cost of inventory storage and distribution fall, a wide range of products become available. This can, in turn, have the effect of reducing demand for the most popular products.

Some of the most successful Internet businesses have leveraged the Long Tail as part of their businesses. Examples include eBay (auctions), Yahoo! and Google (web search), Amazon (retail) and iTunes Store (music and podcasts) amongst the major companies, along with smaller Internet companies like Audible (audio books) and Netflix (video rental).

In following a long-tailed innovation strategy, the company is using the model to tap into a large group of users that are in the low-intensity area of the distribution. It is their collaboration and aggregated work that results in an innovation effort. Innovation communities formed by large groups of users can perform rapidly the trial and error process of innovation, share information, test and diffuse the results.

The Long Tail has possible implications for culture and politics. Where the opportunity cost of inventory storage and distribution is high, only the most popular products are sold. But where the Long Tail works, minority tastes become available and individuals are presented a wider array of choices. The Long Tail presents opportunities for various suppliers to introduce products in the niche category. These encourage the diversification of products.

* With online distribution and retail we are entering a world of abundance.
* When you dramatically lower the costs of connecting supply and demand, it changes not just the numbers, but the entire nature of the market.
* In an era without the constraints of physical shelf space and bottlenecks of distribution, narrowly targeted goods and services can be as economically attractive as mainstream fare.
* In virtually all markets there are far more niche goods than hits, and the cost of reaching those niches is falling dramatically. Demand can be driven doen the Tail by "filters", such as seach engines and recommendations.

Seeing What's Next
------------------

* Framework for predicting outcomes in the evolution of any industry.
* Three-part model that helps decision-makers spot the signals of industry change, determine the outcome of competitive battles, and assess whether a firm's actions will ensure or threaten future success.
* Sustaining innovations are what move companies along established improvement trajectories. They are improvements to existing products on dimensions historically valued by customers.
* Disruptive innovation introduce a new value proposition. They either create new markets or reshape existing ones. 
* Two types of disruptive innovations: 
  * Low-end. Occur when existing products and services are "too good" and hence overpriced relative to the value existing customers can use.
  * New-market. Occur when characteristics of existing products limit the number of potential consumers or force consumption to take place in inconvenient, centralized settings.
* The Resources, Processes and Values (RPV) theory holds that resources (what a firm has), processes (how it does its work), and values (what a firm wants to do) collectively define an organization's strengths, weaknesses and blind spots.
* Resources are things or assets that organizations can buy or sell, build or destroy. Processes are the established patterns of work by which companies transform inputs into outputs of greater worth. Values determine the criteria by which organizations allocate their resources.
* The Value Chain Evolution (VCE) theory assess whether a company has made the right organizational design decisions to compete successfully.
* VCE's golden rule: Integrate to improve what is "not good enough" and out-source what is "more than good enough". Solving the hard problems allows firms to capture value.
